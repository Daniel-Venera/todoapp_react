This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple todolist app, where you can add tasks and check them.

You can Run the app in the development mode with `yarn start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I've deployed the app in GitHub Pages here : https://daniel-venera.github.io/todoapp_react/

As you see it in the app, next modifications and features are coming.

This was my first project in React so I hope you enjoy it !
